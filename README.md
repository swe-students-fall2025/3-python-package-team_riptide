# joytide

joytide is a small python package written by team_riptide for project 3 in our software engineering course.

the idea is: a set of random simple fun helper functions (ascii banner text, confetti style output, compliments, small dancing frames, etc) plus a `surprise_me()` function that calls one of them at random so the user doesn't need to remember names.
